A simple file finder I made to improve the efficiency of my old job.

If a formula needed a quat/epton test performed on it, we had to open a specific file from a massively sized directory. This automates the process by having a user open the app, they simply type in the code tied to the formula, and the correct file instantly opens for them. 

The only thing I don't like about this is that the directory being searched for is a string literal, so if the folder that holds these files ever got moved/renamed this would need an update. Changes could've been made to avoid this but I think it would've taken away from how fast this version is, and such a problem won't be an issue.
